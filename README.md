# SamimiModel

SAMIMI (Salinity/Sodicity Management with an Interactive Model Interface)

The model is developed to simulate soil salinization and sodification to test
the long-term impact of alternative agricultural water management practices on soil degradation and crop yields on farmlands. 
SAMIMI simulates the hydraulic flows and solute transport in vertical soil compartments on daily basis and evaluates end of the season crop yields.

The management simulator adopts the system dynamic method. 
Through the interface available on an online platform introduced in this study, the model offers capabilities for long-term simulations,
appealing to not only the experts but to a large community of users to experiment on the impact of agricultural water management on soil quality and crop yields.
In that regard, the simulator is intended for use as a learning platform for soil conservation against salt-induced problems.

The model is developed by Mehmet Can Tunca and Ali Kerem Saysel at the Institue of Environmental Sciences in Boğaziçi University.
The study is funded by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey. [Project Number: TUBITAK-118Y343]
